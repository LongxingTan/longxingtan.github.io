## First

The unexamined life is not worth living. When I looked back my life, there are so many meaningless things full of my life. Mindset and attitude


I believe that there is another world existing in parallel with ours.
In another world, it's full of order, law, and principles. Another world works according to all this, but you can only realize it and enjoy it after lots of thinking.


To be honest, it's always easy to lost in our world. You may put too much attention on grade while studying in school, you may put too much attention on the house price, family, hierarchy conflict while working in company, or you may just spend lots of time on social media, TV shows and vlog etc. such kind of entertainment things. The real world is really so interesting that you enjoy it or hate it so much. But at last, I will say both of the way is limited.

Because you miss the whole another world, a more interesting world.
